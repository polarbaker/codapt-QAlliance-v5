# Debugging Recommendations - Quick Reference

> **Note**: This document has been superseded by comprehensive documentation. Please refer to:
> - **[README.md](../README.md)** - Complete codebase documentation and architecture
> - **[Image Upload System](./IMAGE_UPLOAD_SYSTEM.md)** - Comprehensive image upload documentation
> - **[Troubleshooting Guide](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - General troubleshooting across all systems

## Quick Debug Commands

### System Health Check
```bash
# Check all services
docker-compose ps

# View application logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Monitor memory usage
docker stats

# Check database connection
npx prisma db pull
```

### Image Upload Specific
```bash
# Check memory configuration
docker inspect app | grep -i memory

# Monitor image processing
docker logs app | grep -i "image\|memory\|sharp"

# Check Minio connection
docker-compose exec minio mc admin info local
```

### Common Quick Fixes
```bash
# Memory issues
docker-compose restart app

# Database issues
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate

# Build issues
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build

# Clear Docker cache
docker system prune -a
```

## Architecture Improvements Made

Based on the issues identified in this document, the following improvements have been implemented:

### ✅ Simplified Architecture
- **Consolidated image upload system** into unified components
- **Streamlined processing pipeline** with clear strategy selection
- **Unified error handling** with consistent response formats
- **Comprehensive documentation** in single locations

### ✅ Enhanced Error Handling
- **Categorized error types** with specific recovery suggestions
- **Automatic retry mechanisms** with exponential backoff
- **User-friendly error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Progressive error disclosure** with helpful hints

### ✅ Improved Memory Management
- **Real-time memory monitoring** with pressure detection
- **Conservative memory limits** with automatic cleanup
- **Strategy-based processing** adapting to available resources
- **Emergency fallback procedures** for critical memory situations

### ✅ Better Debugging Tools
- **Comprehensive logging** with structured error information
- **Performance metrics** tracking processing times and success rates
- **Request tracing** with unique identifiers
- **Memory statistics** with detailed usage information
