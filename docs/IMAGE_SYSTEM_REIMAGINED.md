# Reimagined Image Upload System

## Overview

The image upload system has been completely reimagined and rebuilt from the ground up to address critical issues with reliability, performance, and user experience. This document outlines the improvements made and how the new system works.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Authentication Issues
**Problem**: `Invalid or expired admin token` errors were preventing image uploads
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced JWT token validation with better error logging
- Improved token generation with explicit configuration
- Better error messages for different token failure scenarios
- Automatic token refresh recommendations

### 2. Memory Management Issues
**Problem**: System was running out of memory during image processing
**Solution**:
- Conservative memory usage limits (80% threshold)
- Simplified image processing pipeline
- Automatic garbage collection triggers
- Memory pressure monitoring
- Reduced batch sizes (3 images max vs previous 10)

### 3. Overly Complex System
**Problem**: Previous system was over-engineered with too many features running simultaneously
**Solution**:
- Simplified architecture focused on core functionality
- Removed complex variant generation during upload
- Streamlined error handling
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 4. Poor Error Handling
**Problem**: Users received confusing error messages without actionable guidance
**Solution**:
- Categorized error types (memory, format, size, auth, network)
- Specific suggestions for each error type
- Progressive error disclosure with helpful hints
- Visual feedback with appropriate icons and colors

### 5. Preview Functionality Issues
**Problem**: Image previews were unreliable and often failed to load
**Solution**:
- Robust preview error handling
- Loading states with visual feedback
- Fallback displays when previews fail
- Clear messaging about processing status

## New Architecture

### Backend (`src/server/trpc/procedures/image-upload.ts`)

#### Core Procedures
- `adminUploadImage`: Single image upload with comprehensive validation
- `adminBulkUploadImages`: Batch upload (max 3 images for reliability)
- `getImage`: Simplified image retrieval from storage
- `adminDeleteImage`: Clean image deletion from storage and database
- `adminListImages`: Paginated image listing with search

#### Key Features
- **Memory Safety**: Conservative limits and monitoring
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic cleanup on failures
- **Processing Optimization**: Resize large images (>2048px) automatically
- **Format Standardization**: Convert to JPEG/PNG for web compatibility
- **Metadata Tracking**: Store processing information and original file details

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Authentication**: Verify admin token
2. **Validation**: Check file format, size, and content
3. **Memory Check**: Ensure system has sufficient resources
4. **Processing**: Resize and optimize images using Sharp
5. **Storage**: Upload to Minio with metadata
6. **Database**: Save file information and processing details
7. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on any failure

### Frontend (`src/components/ui/ImageUpload.tsx`)

#### Enhanced Features
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive file selection
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on file selection
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual upload progress with detailed status
- **Preview System**: Robust image previews with error handling
- **Batch Support**: Multiple file uploads with individual progress
- **Metadata Editor**: Optional detailed information for images

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Clear Messaging**: Specific error messages with actionable suggestions
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, success/error indicators
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant information at the right time
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Validation System (`src/constants/validation.ts`)

#### Simplified Validation
- **File Type Detection**: Support for all major image formats
- **Size Limits**: 25MB per file, 75MB total for batches
- **Format Recommendations**: Guidance based on use case
- **Error Categorization**: Structured error responses with suggestions

#### Smart Error Handling
```typescript
export const getUploadErrorMessage = (error: string): {
  message: string;
  suggestions: string[];
  canRetry: boolean;
  severity: 'error' | 'warning';
  category: string;
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production-this-must-be-at-least-32-chars
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
```

### Memory Limits
- **Single File**: 25MB maximum
- **Batch Upload**: 3 files maximum, 75MB total
- **Memory Threshold**: 80% system memory usage
- **Processing Limits**: 4096x4096 pixels maximum input

### Storage Configuration
- **Provider**: Minio object storage
- **Bucket**: `images`
- **Format**: Automatic conversion to JPEG/PNG
- **Optimization**: Automatic resizing for large images

## Usage Examples

### Single Image Upload
```tsx
<ImageUpload
  value={imageUrl}
  onChange={(filePath) => setValue("image", filePath)}
  placeholder="Upload profile image"
  previewClassName="h-48"
/>
```

### Bulk Image Upload
```tsx
<ImageUpload
  value={imageUrls}
  onChange={(filePaths) => setValue("images", filePaths)}
  multiple={true}
  maxImages={3}
  showMetadata={true}
/>
```

### With Metadata
```tsx
<ImageUpload
  value={imageUrl}
  onChange={(filePath) => setValue("image", filePath)}
  showMetadata={true}
  placeholder="Upload with detailed information"
/>
```

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
1. **Memory**: System resource limitations
2. **Format**: Unsupported file types
3. **Size**: File too large
4. **Auth**: Authentication failures
5. **Network**: Connection issues
6. **Timeout**: Processing timeouts

### User-Friendly Messages
